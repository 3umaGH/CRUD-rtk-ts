# CRUD App with React, MUI, TypeScript, Redux, and Thunk

## Overview

This is a simple CRUD (Read, Update, Delete) application built using React, Material-UI (MUI), TypeScript, Redux, and Thunk. The app fetches data from an API and gracefully falls back to local data in case of a failure. It also supports entry deletion and updating.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: React UI framework implementing Google's Material Design.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript adding static types to the language.
- **Redux**: State management library for JavaScript applications.
- **Thunk**: Middleware for Redux allowing asynchronous logic in action creators.
